    <h2>China 🇨🇳</h2>
    <p>China is the birthplace of the cherished beverage known as tea. Legend has it that around 2737 BC, Emperor Shen Nung found himself resting beneath a tree while his servant was boiling water for drinking. As fate would have it, leaves from the tree blew into the pot of boiling water. Emperor Shen Nung, renowned for his knowledge of herbs, decided to sample the accidental infusion created by his servant. Little did he know that the tree in question was the Camellia sinensis, and the resulting blend would later be recognized as the beverage we now know as tea. Through the ages, tea slowly became woven into the fabric of China’s identity, shaping a profound and enduring relationship that persists to this day.

        <h2>Japan 🇯🇵</h2>
        <p>In the 8th century, during the Nara period (710-794), Japan's initial knowledge about tea likely arrived through diplomatic missions to China's Tang dynasty, bringing back culture, customs, and the art of tea. In the subsequent Heian period (794-1185), Buddhist monks Kūkai and Saichō played a significant role, introducing tea to Japan after their return from China, though it remained primarily within Buddhist circles for ceremonial purposes. By the late Heian period, tea experienced a surge in popularity, largely attributed to Zen monk Myōan Eisai (1141-1215), who planted tea seeds upon his return from China, promoting the beverage's health benefits and transforming its perception in Japanese culture.

        <h2>Korea 🇰🇷</h2>
        <p>Korean tea culture has garnered world-wide attention for its tea ceremony, referred to as "darye," a tradition with a captivating history that spans more than a millennium. It was a cherished tradition in Korea, with various forms of tea ceremonies practiced, especially during the Joseon dynasty. Tea played a significant role in national rituals, and though challenges such as climate and agricultural balance affected tea production, it remained an integral part of Korean culture. However, tea culture faced a decline after the Japanese occupation and the Korean War. Revival efforts began in the 1970s with the "Korean Tea Culture Revival Movement," led by individuals like Choe Kilsung and Lee Gwilye, who established the Korean Tea People's Association. These initiatives aimed to rediscover and preserve the art of the Korean tea ceremony in the modern context.

        <h2>India 🇮🇳</h2>
        <p>India has a rich and diverse tea culture, renowned as the second-largest tea producer globally, notably for Assam and Darjeeling teas. The practice of Ayurveda has led to the use of herbal teas in traditional Indian kitchens, with medicinal benefits from various plants and spices like holy basil, cardamom, and ginger. While tea consumption has a long history, British colonial influence and the East India Company's large-scale production in the 19th century spurred India's growth as a major tea producer, with Assam leading the way. India's tea industry has modernised, owning global brands, and being technologically advanced. The country's geographical tea varieties, including Darjeeling, Assam, Nilgiri, and others, are protected as Geographical Indicators. Tea is a significant part of daily life, enjoyed in various forms like masala chai, often with milk and sugar, and regional variations abound.
