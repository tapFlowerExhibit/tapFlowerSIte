  <h1>TAP Ceremony</h1>

    <h2>Fist Gesture:</h2>
    <p>To perform the Fist Gesture, start by making a fist just above the tea bowl. Then, release your fist as if you're gently dropping something into the bowl. As if by magic, your projected flower will burst into life, unfolding its petals before your eyes, mirroring the beauty of dropping tea leaves into the boiled water. Watch in delight as the act of dropping invokes a symphony of growth and colour.

          <h2>Tap Gesture:</h2>
          <p>To perform the Tap Gesture, gently place one finger outside the tea bowl and tap on the water's surface. Watch in awe as your projected flower gracefully withers away, its petals drifting off with the breeze. In its place, a fresh bloom will emerge, painting the moment anew with its vibrant colours.

        <h2>Rotate Gesture:
        </h2>
        <p>To perform the Rotate gesture, position your hand horizontally over the bowl and initiate a smooth circular motion. When moving your hand in a clockwise circle, marvel as the projected flower grows larger. Conversely, when tracing an anti-clockwise circle, witness the flower decrease in size.

        <h2>Swipe Gesture
        </h2>
        <p>To perform the Swipe Gesture, execute a swift and fluid swipe motion across the bowl using your hand. This motion seamlessly whisks you to the next flower of the selected country. This swipe interaction enables you to experience each different flower of the selected culture before the exhibition moves onto the next country.
